# superherohunter.github.io
Hello! i have created a basic super hero humter app project using simple html, css, javarscript and linking with marvel api.
In this project you will find the following features.

Home Page:

Home page is clean, it just has a searchbar to type the name of superhero that you wish to know about and even by using their gender. It shows the matching super characters as you type just like google does. Simply click on the matching results to know more about that character.
